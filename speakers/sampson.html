					Scott Sampson</h2>

				<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the
				Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the
				Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
				ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a <br>number
				of countries in Africa.<br><br>

				Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
				University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
				dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid
				horns and frills.<br><br>

				Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
				History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New
				York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
				accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
				and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
				interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of
				Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.<br><br>

				In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
				work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
				also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book,
				Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most
				comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
